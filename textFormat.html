        Dear [Principal's Name],

            I am writing to request a leave of absence from school for a period of 5 days, starting from [date] to [date]. Due to [reason for leave], I will not be able to attend school during this time.

            I have made arrangements for my work to be completed and submitted before I leave, and I have also discussed my absence with my teachers to ensure that there will be minimal disruption to my studies.

            I would greatly appreciate your consideration of this request, and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work upon my return.

            Thank you for your understanding.

            Sincerely,
            [Your Name]
    </pre>
